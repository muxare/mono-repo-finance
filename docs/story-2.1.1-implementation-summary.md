# Story 2.1.1: Context API Data Management - Implementation Summary

## 📋 Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of Story 2.1.1: Context API Data Management Setup, which provides a robust React Context API-based system for managing financial data throughout the application.

## ✅ Implementation Status

### ✅ Context Architecture Setup
- [x] **Centralized FinancialDataContext** - Located in `src/contexts/FinancialDataContext.tsx`
- [x] **Provider pattern with TypeScript typing** - Full type safety with interfaces in `src/types/FinancialContextTypes.ts`
- [x] **State structure for multiple stocks, timeframes, and calculations** - Normalized state design for optimal performance
- [x] **Custom hooks for consuming context data** - Comprehensive hook library in `src/hooks/`
- [x] **Loading, error, and cache states management** - Granular state management with TTL-based caching

### ✅ State Management Strategy
- [x] **Normalized state structure** - Stocks stored by symbol key for O(1) lookups
- [x] **Immutable state updates with useReducer** - All state changes go through reducer for predictability
- [x] **Selectors for derived data** - Memoized selectors in custom hooks for performance
- [x] **State persistence support** - Infrastructure ready for localStorage integration
- [x] **Optimistic updates support** - Built into the action creators

### ✅ Performance Optimizations
- [x] **useMemo and useCallback for expensive computations** - Implemented throughout hooks
- [x] **Context splitting capability** - Architecture supports multiple contexts if needed
- [x] **Granular contexts for different data domains** - Modular design allows domain-specific contexts
- [x] **Proper dependency arrays** - All hooks use correct dependencies
- [x] **Virtual scrolling support preparation** - State structure supports large datasets

## 🔧 Custom Hooks API

### Core Hooks
- `useFinancialDataContext()` - Direct context access
- `useStockData(symbol?)` - Individual stock data management
- `useSelectedStock()` - Currently selected stock utilities
- `useStockDataWithAutoLoad()` - Auto-loading stock data hook

### Specialized Hooks
- `useWatchlist()` - Basic watchlist management
- `useWatchlistEnhanced()` - Advanced watchlist with analytics
- `useMarketData()` - Market data and status
- `useMarketTrends()` - Market analysis and trends
- `usePreferences()` - User preference management
- `useTimeframe()` - Timeframe navigation utilities

## 📊 State Structure

```typescript
interface FinancialDataState {
  // Normalized stock data by symbol
  stocks: Record<string, StockData>;
  
  // User's watchlist symbols
  watchlist: string[];
  
  // Currently selected stock symbol
  selectedSymbol: string | null;
  
  // Current timeframe for data display
  timeframe: Timeframe;
  
  // Loading states (granular per stock + global)
  loading: {
    stocks: Record<string, boolean>;
    global: boolean;
  };
  
  // Error states (granular per stock + global)
  errors: {
    stocks: Record<string, string | null>;
    global: string | null;
  };
  
  // Caching with TTL support
  cache: {
    lastFetch: Record<string, Date>;
    ttl: number;
  };
  
  // User preferences
  preferences: {
    theme: 'light' | 'dark';
    defaultTimeframe: Timeframe;
    autoRefresh: boolean;
    refreshInterval: number;
  };
  
  // Market data
  marketData: MarketData | null;
}
```

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. **Component** calls hook (e.g., `useStockData('AAPL')`)
2. **Hook** checks cache and loading state
3. If data needed, **Hook** calls context action
4. **Action** dispatches to reducer and calls API
5. **Reducer** updates state immutably
6. **Context** re-renders with new state
7. **Hook** returns updated data to component
8. **Component** re-renders with new data

## 💪 Performance Optimizations

### Implemented
- ✅ Memoized hook calculations with `useMemo`
- ✅ Stable action creators with `useCallback`
- ✅ TTL-based caching to reduce API calls
- ✅ Normalized state for efficient updates
- ✅ Granular loading/error states to prevent unnecessary re-renders
