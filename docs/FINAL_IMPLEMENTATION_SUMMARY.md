- ✅ Updated existing documentation with new practices
- ✅ Provided clear migration guides and best practices

## Application Features Demonstrated

### UI Enhancements

- **Modern Card-based Layout**: Main content organized in visually appealing cards
- **Interactive Modal**: Environment information displayed in a clean modal dialog
- **Button Variants**: Primary, secondary, and outline button styles
- **Error Boundaries**: Robust error handling with shared ErrorBoundary components
- **Responsive Design**: Components designed to work across different screen sizes

### Shared Package Integration

- **Currency Formatting**: Using shared utilities for consistent currency display
- **Environment Detection**: Shared configuration for environment-specific features
- **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript typing across all shared packages
- **Reusable Components**: UI components that can be used across multiple apps

### Development Experience

- **Hot Module Replacement**: Fast development with Vite
- **TypeScript Integration**: Full type checking across all packages
- **Build Optimization**: Turborepo caching for faster builds
- **Dependency Management**: Clean separation of concerns with proper dependencies

## Technical Metrics

### Build Performance

- ✅ All 5 packages build successfully
- ✅ Turborepo cache hits for unchanged packages
- ✅ Web app builds in ~1 second with optimizations
- ✅ Total build time: ~8.6 seconds for full monorepo

### Package Sizes

- shared-types: 2.94 KB (built)
- shared-utils: 6.01 KB (built)
- shared-config: 6.20 KB (built)
- shared-ui: 11.77 KB (built)
- web app: 278.04 KB (built, gzipped: 89.69 KB)

### Code Quality

- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes for all packages
- ✅ No runtime errors in development
- ✅ Proper error boundaries for robust error handling
- ⚠️ ESLint v9 migration pending (builds work, linting config needs updates)

## Known Issues & Future Improvements

### Pending Items

1. **ESLint v9 Migration**: Shared packages need updated ESLint configs (builds work fine)
2. **Additional Lint Rules**: Web app has some type-related warnings to address
3. **API Integration**: Further integration testing with the .NET API
4. **Additional Components**: More shared UI components could be added

### Optional Enhancements

- Add shared React hooks for API calls
- Implement theme system in shared-ui
- Add comprehensive testing setup
- Add Storybook for component documentation
- Implement CI/CD optimizations

## Critical Bug Fix: Environment Variable Handling

### Issue Resolved

- ✅ **Fixed "Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined"** runtime error
- ✅ **Improved cross-platform environment variable handling** in shared-config package

### Root Cause

The shared-config package was directly accessing `process.env` in browser environment, which is a Node.js-specific global not available in browsers.

### Solution Implemented

1. **Created Universal Environment Helper**: Added `getEnvVar()` function that works in both browser and Node.js environments
2. **Browser Support**: Uses `import.meta.env` (Vite's environment variables) in browser
3. **Node.js Support**: Falls back to `process.env` in Node.js environment
4. **Default Values**: Provides sensible defaults for all environment variables
5. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript definitions for Vite environment variables

### Technical Details

```typescript
// Before (problematic)
baseUrl: process.env.VITE_API_URL || 'https://localhost:7203'

// After (fixed)
function getEnvVar(key: string, defaultValue: string = ''): string {
  // Browser environment (Vite)
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    try {
      const env = import.meta?.env;
      if (env && env[key] !== undefined) {
        return env[key];
      }
    } catch (e) {
      // Fallback if import.meta is not available
    }
  }
  
  // Node.js environment
  if (typeof process !== 'undefined' && process.env && process.env[key] !== undefined) {
    return process.env[key]!;
  }
  
  return defaultValue;
}

baseUrl: getEnvVar('VITE_API_URL', 'https://localhost:7203')
```

### Files Updated

- ✅ `libs/shared-config/src/index.ts` - Fixed environment variable handling
- ✅ `apps/web/.env` - Added proper Vite environment variables
- ✅ `apps/web/src/vite-env.d.ts` - Added TypeScript definitions for environment variables

### Verification

- ✅ Build succeeds without errors
- ✅ Development server runs without runtime errors  
- ✅ Application loads successfully in browser
- ✅ Environment configuration works in both Node.js and browser environments
- ✅ All shared packages continue to work correctly

### Environment Variables Configured

```bash
VITE_API_URL=https://localhost:7203
VITE_WS_URL=wss://localhost:7203
VITE_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
```

## Verification Steps

To verify the implementation:

1. **Build Verification**:

   ```bash
   pnpm turbo build
   ```

2. **Development Server**:

   ```bash
   cd apps/web && pnpm dev
   ```

3. **Browse Application**:
   - Open <http://localhost:5173>
   - Click "View Environment Info" to see modal
   - Test button interactions
   - Verify shared package integration

4. **Cache Performance**:

   ```bash
   pnpm turbo build  # Second run should show cache hits
   ```

- ✅ Industry-standard tooling (Turborepo + Nx)
- ✅ Comprehensive shared package ecosystem
- ✅ Modern React application using shared components
- ✅ Optimized build pipeline with caching
- ✅ Strong TypeScript integration
