# Story 1.4: Data Calculation Service

## üìã Story Overview
- **Epic**: Data Infrastructure & Backend Services
- **Story ID**: 1.4
- **Priority**: High
- **Story Points**: 8
- **Sprint**: 2

## üéØ User Story
**As a** frontend developer  
**I want** pre-calculated financial metrics and indicators from the backend  
**So that** I can display real-time data efficiently without client-side computation overhead

## üìù Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Calculate price changes and percentage changes server-side
- [ ] Compute technical indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
- [ ] Generate time-series aggregations (daily, weekly, monthly views)
- [ ] Provide statistical calculations (volatility, correlation, beta)
- [ ] Cache calculations for performance optimization
- [ ] Support real-time calculation updates

## üîß Technical Tasks

### Core Calculation Service
- [ ] **Price Calculations (`PriceCalculationService.cs`)**
  - Price change (absolute and percentage)
  - Intraday high/low tracking
  - Gap analysis (opening vs previous close)
  - Volume-weighted average price (VWAP)

- [ ] **Technical Indicators Service (`TechnicalIndicatorService.cs`)**
  - Simple Moving Average (SMA) - configurable periods
  - Exponential Moving Average (EMA) - configurable periods
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI) - 14-day default
  - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
  - Bollinger Bands with standard deviation
  - Support/Resistance level detection

- [ ] **Statistical Analysis Service (`StatisticalAnalysisService.cs`)**
  - Historical volatility calculations
  - Correlation analysis between stocks
  - Beta calculation against market indices
  - Risk metrics (Sharpe ratio, Value at Risk)
  - Performance attribution analysis

### Data Processing Pipeline
- [ ] **Background Calculation Jobs**
  - Scheduled calculation updates (every market close)
  - Real-time calculation triggers for live data
  - Batch processing for historical data backfill
  - Error handling and retry mechanisms

- [ ] **Caching Strategy**
  - Redis cache for frequently accessed calculations
  - Hierarchical cache invalidation
  - Cache warming strategies
  - Performance monitoring and optimization

### API Integration
- [ ] **Extended Stock API Endpoints**
  - GET `/api/stocks/{symbol}/calculations` - All pre-calculated metrics
  - GET `/api/stocks/{symbol}/indicators` - Technical indicators with parameters
  - GET `/api/stocks/{symbol}/statistics` - Statistical analysis data
  - GET `/api/stocks/{symbol}/performance` - Performance metrics over time periods

- [ ] **Real-time Calculation Updates**
  - WebSocket notifications for calculation updates
  - Incremental calculation pushes
  - Efficient data serialization for frontend consumption

## üéØ Implementation Details

### Calculation Models
```csharp
public class CalculatedMetrics
{
    public decimal PriceChange { get; set; }
    public decimal ChangePercent { get; set; }
    public decimal DayHigh { get; set; }
    public decimal DayLow { get; set; }
    public decimal VWAP { get; set; }
    public decimal Volatility { get; set; }
    public DateTime CalculatedAt { get; set; }
}

public class TechnicalIndicators
{
    public Dictionary<int, decimal> SMA { get; set; } // Period -> Value
    public Dictionary<int, decimal> EMA { get; set; } // Period -> Value
    public decimal RSI { get; set; }
    public MacdData MACD { get; set; }
    public BollingerBands BollingerBands { get; set; }
}
```

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Calculate indicators for 1000+ stocks in under 5 minutes
- [ ] Real-time calculations complete within 100ms
- [ ] Cache hit ratio > 90% for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Support concurrent calculation requests

### Data Quality & Validation
- [ ] Input data validation before calculations
- [ ] Anomaly detection in calculated results
- [ ] Historical data consistency checks
- [ ] Graceful handling of missing data points

## üîó Dependencies
- **Story 1.1**: Database Design & Entity Framework Setup
- **Story 1.2**: Financial Data API Endpoints
- **Story 1.3**: Data Import Service

## üéØ Success Metrics
- [ ] All financial calculations moved from frontend to backend
- [ ] API response times < 200ms for calculated data
- [ ] 100% calculation accuracy vs manual verification
- [ ] Zero client-side computation for financial metrics
- [ ] Real-time calculation updates functional

## üìã Testing Strategy
- [ ] Unit tests for all calculation algorithms
- [ ] Integration tests for calculation pipeline
- [ ] Performance tests for calculation speed
- [ ] Accuracy tests against known financial datasets
- [ ] Load tests for concurrent calculation requests

## üöÄ Future Enhancements
- [ ] Machine learning prediction models
- [ ] Custom indicator builder interface
- [ ] Portfolio-level calculations and analytics
- [ ] Sector and market-wide statistical analysis
- [ ] Integration with external financial data providers
